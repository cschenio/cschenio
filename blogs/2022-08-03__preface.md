# Should I write?

Should I start to write blogs? I was never a content producer, though I&apos;d love to talk and to say stories that I&apos;ve heard of or personally experienced. And I&apos;ve kept believing that writing everyday should result in lots of rewards in the long run. But could I write as frequently as I can? What would be my writing style? What shall be the topics that I have passion to write about? I have no idea, but let&apos;s see if I can concentrate and keep working on this long project.
